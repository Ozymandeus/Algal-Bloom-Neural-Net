# Algal-Bloom-Neural-Net
The goal of thi porject is to create a Neural Net that will examine the month by month progress of algal blooms in the Great Lakes and create a predicative algorithm that you can input a picture of the great lakes to as well as some other data like the time of year. It will be able to ouput a photo that is a prediction of what the algal bloom in that photo will look like in a month, 3 months, and a year. We are using http://www.greatlakesremotesensing.org/ for our data.
